# MapReduceSimulator
Based on an internal event based framework to simulate parallel processes in a single threaded computation, this project provides Implementations and examples of MapReduce operations, simulated on large clusters.
Binary examples should be executed via a terminal instance to get more information about stats like simulation duration.

Comments will be added soon :)
